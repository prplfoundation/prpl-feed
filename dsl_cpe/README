Proof of Concept for DSL PHY Subsystem (DSL POC)

Update the feeds and install DSL PHY related packages from the feeds
```
./scripts/feeds update
./scripts/feeds install dsl-vr11-firmware-xdsl dsl-cpe-mei-vrx dsl-cpe-api-vrx dsl-cpe-control-vrx ifxos
```

Apply the following configurations within "make menuconfig"
```
Intel -> DSL Subsystem ->
   -*- dsl-cpe-api-vrx
   <*> dsl-cpe-control-vrx
   -*- dsl-cpe-mei-vrx
      Configuration  --->
         Device selection (VRX500)
         Debug & Test mode (Standalone)
         IRQ Polling mode (Active IRQ polling mode)
         PPA Version (Without PPA support)
      <*>   dsl-vr11-firmware-xdsl
Lantiq -> IFXOS ->
   <*> ifxos
Kernel modules -> Intel ->
   <*> kmod-vrx518_ep
```

Run make again to build the image
```
make
```

Within running image on the target DSL PHY related modules will be automatically installed/started and the link will be activated.
Use the following command to get information on the link status.
```
/opt/intel/bin/dsl_cpe_pipe lsg
```

Note:
Due to the missing dependency for the PPE/TC Driver the link will currently not be able to enter showtime (max. line state will be 0x380 and the link will be re-started).
